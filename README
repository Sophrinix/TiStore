Welcome to the Ti Store project

This sample application demonstrates and includes an "ActiveRecord" look-alike (in a very
general sense) ORM (Object Relation Mapper) that allows for easier handling of basic CRUD
operations on JavaScript objects.

The documentation is sparse (i.e. non-existing) at the moment, but I will get around to do more
as time permits.

The code should be simple enough to follow.

Happy coding
